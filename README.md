# Classifiers_Multi_layer_perceptron

## Part 1: basic_classifers.ipynb
Experiments with two classic classification methods: Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and Softmax classifier. 

## Part 2: mlp.ipynb
In this, I have created a multi-layer-perceptron (MLP). It is designed to help you understand how backpropagation works.

## Part 3: dim_reduction.ipynb
In this, I have worked on the dimensionality reduction. Two methods will be introduced - principle component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE).

## Task 4: Fundamental Questions on Deep learning
In this, I have answered questions related to machine learning basics and training of neural networks.
